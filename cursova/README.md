# The Graduate Work of Olexiy Bahirev
## I created an automation deployment of web application that consist of two containerized microservices (node web server + mysql database).
## The application hosts on AWS EC2 instance. 
## To automate infrastructure deployment I used infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool Terraform
## I used Docker Compose to define and spin up my multi-container application
## Also I wrote a bash script to bundle all together and automate application deployment after EC2 instance creation
## For safely store and use my AWS Access Keys I used  AWS CLI tool
